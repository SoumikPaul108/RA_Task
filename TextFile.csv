"CNN —

Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday that he will not seek the Republican nomination for president in 2024, worried that his candidacy in a crowded primary could help former President Donald Trump clear the GOP field and win the nomination.

“I have long said that I care more about ensuring a future for the Republican Party than securing my own future in the Republican Party. That is why I will not be seeking the Republican nomination for president,” he said in a statement.

After leaving office in January, Hogan said that he was seriously considering running for president.

But on Sunday, the longtime Trump critic said that “the stakes are too high for me to risk being part of another multicar pileup that could potentially help Mr. Trump recapture the nomination.”

Trump is making his third bid for the Republican nomination in a race that has been slow to take shape. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy entered the primary last month. Potential contenders for the GOP nomination include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President MIke Pence, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

In his statement Sunday, Hogan, who served two terms as Maryland governor, argued that his party needs to “move on” from Trump, and he vowed “to stay in the fight” for the direction of the GOP.

“Our nation faces great challenges; we can’t afford to be consumed by the pettiest grievances. We can push back and defeat the excesses of elitist policies on the left without resorting to angry, divisive and performative politics,” he said.

A relatively moderate Republican, Hogan has long been critical of Trump’s influence on the party and did not vote for him in 2016 or 2020.

Hogan was even seen as a potential challenger to Trump in the 2020 GOP primary but decided to instead focus on his second term as governor, acknowledging at the time that it would difficult to overcome the president’s popularity among the Republican base.

This election cycle, it’s unclear whether a Hogan candidacy would have appealed to the GOP base in a field with other more viable alternatives to Trump.

“Right now, you have Trump and DeSantis at the top of the field, soaking up all the oxygen, getting all the attention, and then a whole lot of the rest of us in single digits,” Hogan told CBS News in an interview that aired Sunday. “And the more of them you have, the less chance you have for somebody rising up.”

The Maryland Republican plans to “wait and see” how the GOP field develops before making an endorsement, his spokesperson David Weinman told CNN.

Hogan told CBS News that he could “absolutely” support Pence. The two have been friendly, and Hogan plans to attend the same foreign policy forum as the former vice president later this month in Iowa.

In interviews, Hogan hasn’t ruled out supporting DeSantis should the Florida governor run. But he has pointed out that DeSantis’ style is different from his and has been critical of the governor’s battle with Disney. Hogan also previously said on CNN that DeSantis has to appeal to a broader audience “if he wants a political future beyond Florida.”

Hogan was first elected governor in 2014, comfortably won reelection in 2018 and left office in January with high approval ratings. In recent decades, the state has been dominated by the Democratic Party at the state and federal levels. George H.W. Bush was the last Republican presidential nominee to win the Old Line State, in 1988.

Hogan faced several challenges throughout his governorship: riots in Baltimore, an unprecedented pandemic and a cancer diagnosis.

Hogan is not the first member of his family to go against his party’s standard-bearer. His father, the late former Maryland Rep. Larry Hogan Sr., was the first Republican to advocate GOP President Richard Nixon’s impeachment and the only Republican to vote for all the impeachment articles. The former governor has said that had he been in the US Senate, he would have voted to convict Trump at his 2021 impeachment trial.

In his interview with CBS News, Hogan said he believes that there’s a “big fight” for the “heart and soul of the Republican Party” and that “we’re making progress,” pointing to Trump’s drop in support among Republicans following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

Trump still presents a “formidable challenge,” he said, but “a year is an eternity in politics” and the 2024 race could be completely different a year from now.

Asked if his decision not to run is an acknowledgment that Ronald Reagan’s party is fading or dead, Hogan said, “I don’t feel that way at all.”

“We certainly went off in the wrong direction. And we’re not back on track. It’s going to take a while. We’re not there yet. I would say the party of Reagan is not dead and neither is the party of Trump,” he said.

CNN —

America’s least-visited national park is quite a distance from mainland US shores. Almost 5,000 miles away, in fact.

The National Park of American Samoa in the South Pacific is the only National Park Service site south of the equator. In 2022, it had just 1,887 visits, according to new visitation figures released this week by the National Park Service.

Compared with 2021, that number is down by 78%. The park had several Covid-19 closures last year, NPS said.

The national park stretches over three islands with tropical rainforests, volcanic slopes, pristine beaches and thousands of acres of marine habitat, and it’s interwoven with a rich culture.

“In keeping with the meaning of the word Samoa – ‘sacred earth’ – the park helps protect fa’asamoa – the customs, beliefs, and traditions of the 3,000-year-old Samoan culture,” the park’s website says.

The island park is far from the only uncrowded NPS site.

Nearly 400 of the 424 National Park Service sites count visitors. And three quarters of all visits are to just 64 sites. So there are lots of less-visited spots to explore.

Even among the 63 natural expanses that have “national park” in their proper names, there are parks where visitors number in the thousands or tens of thousands – far short of the nearly 13 million that visited Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 2022. It was the most visited of the 63 national parks last year.

The vast state of Alaska – which covers 665,384 square miles – is home to five of the 15 least-visited national parks in 2022.

But while they may be sparsely visited compared with other parks, several of them saw substantial jumps in visitor numbers last year, with increases of 30% to 50% over 2021.

And one Alaska park that was among the least visited in 2021 – Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve – has catapulted out of the list with a 500% increase in visitors, thanks to a more robust return of cruises.

With more and more travelers heading out for the busy spring and summer seasons, the least-visited national parks have a lot to offer those who venture off the most well-worn paths.

15 least-visited US National Parks in 2022

1. National Park of American Samoa - 1,887 recreation visits

Most parkgoers will need a passport to visit this spot in a remote part of the South Pacific. Hawaiian Airlines offers direct flights to American Samoa twice a week from Honolulu. Covid-19 travel requirements were relaxed at the end of last year, and the first cruise ship in three years arrived in January.

The park has units on three islands and stretches across 13,500 acres, some 4,000 of which are marine acres that are mostly coral reefs.

2. Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve, Alaska - 9,457 recreation visits

With no roads, no trails, no cell service and no established campsites, this massive expanse is a true wilderness experience. The park and preserve has six designated Wild Rivers.

“Visitors may wander at will across 8.4 million acres of superlative natural beauty,” the park’s website says. Visitors must be self-sufficient, flexible and “able to execute self-extraction and communication, should an emergency situation arise.” Arrive prepared.

3. Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska - 16,925 recreation visits

There are no roads, campgrounds or entrance gates for this 1.8 million-acre expanse’s human visitors. Half a million caribou migrate through this park, crossing the Kobuk River and Onion Portage, according to the National Park Service. An 8,000-year tradition of hunting caribou here continues today.

Lake Clark National Park & Preserve had fewer than 20,000 visits in 2022. Sceninc Media/Adobe Stock

4. Lake Clark National Park & Preserve, Alaska - 18,187 recreation visits

Stretching across more than 4 million acres, this national park and preserve is home to three designated Wild Rivers and two National Natural Landmark volcanoes. The land holds 10,000 years of human history and preserves the ancestral homelands of the Dena’ina people.

5. Isle Royale National Park, Michigan - 25,454 recreation visits

An isolated archipelago in Lake Superior, Isle Royale boasts 165 miles of trails and more than 30 campgrounds. It’s open from mid-April through the end of October. Ferry and seaplane service typically runs from mid-May through the end of September, according to NPS.

There are fewer mammal species here – only 18 – than on the mainland because animals must cross at least 14 miles of Lake Superior. Wolves and moose are among the notable animal residents.

6. North Cascades National Park, Washington - 30,154 recreation visits

Peaks crowned by more than 300 glaciers tower over this alpine landscape. More than 1,600 species of plants have been identified on this land that spans temperate rainforest to a dry ponderosa pine ecosystem. There are more than 400 miles of trails.

7. Katmai National Park & Preserve, Alaska - 33,908 recreation visits

Katmai is an important habitat for thousands of brown bears. One of the world’s premier bear-viewing spots, according to the Park Service, Katmai is home to an estimated 2,200 brown bears. Brooks Camp along the Brooks River is one of the most popular viewing spots to observe bears feasting on salmon.

8. Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve, Alaska - 65,236 recreation visits

America’s largest national park, Wrangell-St. Elias encompasses 13.2 million acres – or about the size of Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park and Switzerland combined, the Park Service says. Most of the park is backcountry, and visitor services are limited. There are some maintained trails in the frontcountry Nabesna and McCarthy areas.

9. Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida - 78,488 recreation visits

About 70 miles (113 km) west of Key West, Dry Tortugas is mostly open water with seven small islands. Garden Key is home to one of the nation’s largest 19th-century forts, Fort Jefferson. The park is accessible by boat or plane and is host to nearly 300 species of birds. Bush Key closes every year from February to September so that sooty terns and brown noddies can breed there undisturbed.

10. Great Basin National Park, Nevada - 142,115 recreation visits

Mountain peaks meet hot desert valleys here. Great Basin National Park is home to 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak, ancient bristlecone pines, about 40 caves and a wide array of plants and animals. The elevation ranges from 5,000 to 13,000 feet with hiking trails for all levels.

11. Virgin Islands National Park - 196,752 recreation visits

About two thirds of the US Virgin Island of St. John is national park, with sandy beaches, rich marine life, petroglyphs from the indigenous Taino people and sites related to the island’s troubled history of enslaved labor. There are more than 20 trails in the park, which is typically busiest from November to April.

12. Congaree National Park, South Carolina - 204,522 recreation visits

Congaree National Park’s landscape is “defined by the presence of both flood and flame,” the Park Service says.

Floodwaters from the Congaree and Wateree rivers regularly cover the park’s old-growth bottomland hardwood forest, and the upland pine forest depends on wildfires to clear out competing vegetation. Canoeing and kayaking are popular ways to explore the park. There’s a 15-mile marked canoe trail.

13. Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas - 219,987 recreation visits

This park boasts the four highest peaks in Texas and the world’s most extensive Permian fossil reef. Guadalupe Mountains Wilderness has more than 80 miles of trail including a hike in the Salt Basin Dunes that rise 100 feet from the desert floor.

14. Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota - 221,434 recreation visits

Billed as a park of “water, islands and horizons,” Voyageurs covers 218,055 acres – 84,000 of which is water. There are more than 500 islands and four large lakes, plus more than two dozen smaller lakes in the park, which is best experienced by boat. Voyageurs shares its northern boundary with Canada, and lucky visitors may even see the northern lights.

15. Pinnacles National Park, California - 275,023 recreation visits

Pinnacles was formed when volcanoes erupted some 23 million years ago. Talus caves and towering rock spires draw hikers and climbers; there are more than 30 miles of hiking trails and hundreds of climbing routes.

While Pinnacles may rank among the 15 least-visited national parks, it gets very busy on weekends, holidays and throughout the spring, according to a notice on the park’s website. Arrive early to beat the crowds."
"Paris/London CNN —

The European Parliament on Tuesday banned TikTok from staff devices over cybersecurity concerns, meaning the Chinese video-sharing app is now barred in all three of the EU’s main institutions.

“In view of cybersecurity concerns, in particular regarding data protection and collection of data by third parties, the European Parliament has decided, in alignment with other institutions, to suspend as from 20 March 2023, the use of the TikTok mobile application on corporate devices,” it said in a statement.

The parliament also “strongly recommended” that its members and staff remove TikTok from their personal devices.

TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, told CNN “it’s disappointing to see that other government bodies and institutions are banning TikTok on employee devices with no deliberation or evidence.”

“These bans are based on basic misinformation about our company, and we are readily available to meet with officials to set the record straight about our ownership structure and our commitment to privacy and data security. We share a common goal with governments that are concerned about user privacy, but these bans are misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security,” a spokesperson said in a statement.

“We appreciate that some governments have wisely chosen not to implement such bans due to a lack of evidence that there is any such need.”

Last week, the European Commission announced it was banning TikTok from official devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.

A senior EU official in the European Council told CNN that the General Secretariat of the Council, the body that assists the permanent representatives of the EU’s 27 countries based in Brussels, “is in the process of implementing measures similar to those taken by the Commission.”

“It will be uninstalling the application on corporate devices and requesting staff to uninstall it from personal mobile devices that have access to corporate services,” the official added. “The Secretariat continuously keeps its cybersecurity measures under review in close cooperation with the other EU institutions.”

The European Commission said last week their decision to ban TikTok applies only to devices overseen by the EU’s executive branch.

“This measure aims to protect the Commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the Commission,” it said in a statement.

A TikTok spokesperson told CNN in a statement at the time that it had contacted the commission to “set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.”

Previously, TikTok had disclosed to European users that China-based employees may access EU user data. The company also recently announced plans to open two new data centers in Europe.

Agencies ban

TikTok is facing similar scrutiny across the Atlantic.

On Monday, the White House directed federal agencies to remove TikTok from all government-issued devices within 30 days, with few exceptions.

The move added to growing efforts by the United States to clampdown on the app amid renewed security concerns.

US officials have raised concerns that the Chinese government could pressure ByteDance to hand over information collected from users that could be used for intelligence or disinformation purposes. As CNN has previously reported, independent security experts have said that type of access is a possibility, though there has been no reported incident of such access to date.

Brooke Oberwetter, a TikTok spokesperson, called the ban “little more than political theater.”

“The ban of TikTok on federal devices passed in December without any deliberation, and unfortunately that approach has served as a blueprint for other world governments,” Oberwetter said in a statement.

“We hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won’t have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans.”

China also hit back at the decision Tuesday, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson accusing Washington of “generalizing the concept of national security” and “unreasonably suppressing enterprises of other countries.”

The Canadian government announced a similar ban on TikTok from official electronic devices on Monday.

Other nations may soon have to grapple with the same issue.

Asked whether Australia would soon follow the United States, European Union and Canada, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the country hadn’t yet been advised to restrict use of the app by government workers.

“We’ll take the advice of our national security agencies. That hasn’t been the advice to date,” Chalmers told Australia’s ABC broadcaster in an interview on Wednesday."

China pledged to expand its economy by “around 5 percent” this year, a modest goal that underlines the challenges confronting Chinese President Xi Jinping in his third term, as he tries to overcome increasingly hostile relations with the West that have hurt an already struggling economy. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, opened in Beijing on Sunday with a report delivered by outgoing Premier Li Keqiang, who sought to shore up confidence in the Chinese leadership.

Describing the “turbulent international environment,” “uncertainties” and “hidden risks” facing his country as it reemerges from years of isolating and paralyzing coronavirus measures, Li praised Xi’s leadership.

“Struggle creates brilliance. Hard work wins the future,” Li said in a wide-ranging speech that lasted less than an hour and promised to expand the country’s ability to counter outside attempts to contain its development.

This year’s Lianghui, or the Two Sessions — the dual meetings of an advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the National People’s Congress with about 3,000 members representing different sectors of society — comes at a time of deep uncertainty and change for the country.

The National People’s Congress is expected to rubber-stamp senior appointments and a government overhaul that will give Xi and the ruling Communist Party even more control over decision-making previously delegated to government bodies.

At a party congress in October, Xi broke with succession norms to secure a third five-year term, paving the way for him to stay in power for decades. Late last year, the Chinese leadership under Xi oversaw a chaotic reversal of its years-long “zero covid” policy, as well as mass protests on a level not seen since the 1989 pro-democracy movement that ended in a bloody crackdown around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

In February, a high-altitude Chinese balloon discovered floating over the United States caused Washington to cancel a scheduled visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which was meant to put a floor on spiraling U.S.-China ties. Through export restrictions and sanctions, Washington has curbed China’s access to technology related to semiconductors and artificial intelligence.

Beijing also continues to face scrutiny over its friendship with Russia and reticence to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, amid allegations from Washington that Beijing is considering helping Moscow’s war effort.

In a nod to criticism of its foreign policy, Li said China would “resolutely pursue an independent foreign policy of peace.” Without referring to the U.S. restrictions, Li said China successfully countered “external attempts” to contain China’s development and would focus on building “self reliance” in science and technology in its bid to become a global tech power.

Li covered familiar terrain in the work report, reiterating China’s claims over the self-ruled democracy of Taiwan and the need to improve the military readiness of the People’s Liberation Army. A budget released Sunday said that defense spending would increase 7.2 percent to 1.56 trillion yuan ($230 billion), in line with the increases over the past two years.

At the Two Sessions, officials will announce the government’s largest leadership reshuffle in a decade, including a new economic team that will have to grapple with a continued property crisis, rising unemployment, an aging population and a declining consumer and investor confidence. China’s economy grew only 3 percent last year, missing its target of 5.5 percent.

Officials are expected to approve a “reform plan” of party and state institutions that will give the party more control over target-critical areas such as technology, financial regulation and national security, a key focus of Xi’s.

New appointments will include China’s new premier, Li Qiang — an ally of Xi’s and the former party secretary of Shanghai, who oversaw a chaotic lockdown over the city that shifted national public opinion over the zero-covid policy.

In his speech on Sunday, Li Keqiang, the outgoing premier who has been sidelined by Xi for most of his tenure, made no reference to the sudden abandonment of the policy. Li said only that, going forward, the country’s coronavirus measures should be more “scientific” and “targeted.”

The parliament on Sunday also proposed amendments to a lawmaking procedure during an emergency that would allow its decision-making standing committee to skip multiple rounds of discussion before passing legislation. The proposal is almost certain to be passed, potentially allowing a small group of top lawmakers to ram through controversial legislation with minimal oversight or feedback from the public.

The National People’s Congress runs until March 13.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces clung to their positions in Bakhmut on Sunday, fiercely resisting a Russian push to encircle the city in the eastern Donetsk region and prolonging a fight that has become a symbol of Ukraine’s battlefield defiance. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Ukrainian officials have described their grip on Bakhmut, a small industrial city, as increasingly tenuous in recent days, suggesting they may need to withdraw to prevent their troops from being trapped by Russian fighters advancing on three sides.

The fate of the city, which military experts say holds little strategic value, assumes outsize importance a year into President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale war, as Ukraine prepares for what is likely to be a grueling spring offensive and Western leaders scramble to deliver arms and ammunition they hope will tip the scales in its favor.

Advertisement

The months of brutal fighting in Bakhmut, resulting in thousands of dead and wounded on each side, underscores the remote likelihood of any near-term end to a conflict that has overturned decades of relative stability in Europe and intensified strains on the global economy.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking in a nightly video address on Sunday, acknowledged the battlefield difficulties in Ukraine’s embattled east and honored troops fighting there.

“It is one of the toughest battles,” he said. “Painful and challenging.”

While Zelensky has called for Russian forces to be repelled from every inch of his country, Putin has shown no willingness to back away from his own military aims.

The Ukrainian military’s General Staff said that Russia’s invading force continued “to advance in the direction of Bakhmut” on Sunday, citing Russia’s shelling of the city and surrounding villages.

Ukrainian soldiers, facing barrages of what they describe as random artillery, mortar and rocket strikes from nearby Russian troops, are operating mostly from trenches in and around Bakhmut and have few remaining routes toward safer ground.

Ukrainian military personnel who have been in the Bakhmut area in recent days said that Russian fighters have already secured positions in certain parts of the city. Defending forces remain in control of others.

The city, which Russians call by its Soviet-Russian name, Artyomovsk, is now almost completely destroyed, and most of its citizens, from a prewar population of 70,000, have fled.

Russian forces, led by the Wagner mercenary group, have waged a months-long onslaught. If the Ukrainians retreat, they will fall back just a few kilometers to long-planned defensive positions.

Nonetheless, the fight for the city has taken on enormous symbolic value in Kyiv and Moscow, with the Wagner chief, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, seeking to claim a victory for the Kremlin after Russia’s regular military suffered a string of defeats, first in its attempt to capture Kyiv, and then in Ukrainian counteroffensives in the northeast Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions.

Prigozhin has sent wave after wave of fighters, many of them convicted criminals recruited directly to the battlefield from prison, into Bakhmut, taking enormous casualties to make relatively tiny territorial gains.

Zelensky, in turn, has elevated the importance of Bakhmut, calling it “the fortress of our morale” and celebrating the troops defending it. In December, the Ukrainian leader made a rare front-line visit to Bakhmut to meet with troops. When he visited Washington, he gave U.S. lawmakers a flag from the city. Among Ukrainians, “Bakhmut stands” has become a rallying cry.

For Putin, capturing Bakhmut would deliver a needed victory and illustrate progress toward imposing Kremlin control in four eastern regions that the Russian leader has illegally declared as annexed.

The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has recently described the effort to seize four regions — Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — as a matter of upholding the Russian constitution, which was amended to declare the Ukrainian territory as belonging to Russia.

On Friday, Russian occupation officials formally declared Melitopol to be the new regional capital of Zaporizhzhia — a sign both of Russia’s stubborn annexation claims but also of its failure to capture the actual regional capital: Zaporizhzhia city, which lies just east of Dnieper River.

Despite Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive last fall, Russian forces now control roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.

Kyiv’s Western backers, who have funneled an increasingly sophisticated array of weaponry into Ukraine over the past year, have warned it would threaten global security if Russia is permitted to prevail in Ukraine.

President Biden has vowed to support Ukraine “as long as it takes,” pledging continued American help most directly during a surprise visit to Kyiv last month. While the United States has provided some $30 billion in military aid since the conflict began, Biden must now contend with softening support at home, particularly among Republicans, who control the House of Representatives.

In an interview broadcast Sunday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the terms of peace talks that might someday conclude the war must be defined by Ukraine, not its backers in the West. He said the onus for enabling such negotiations fell squarely on Russia.

“To my view, it is necessary that Putin understands that he will not succeed with his invasion and his imperialistic aggression, and that he has to withdraw troops,” he said in an interview with CNN. “This is the basis for talks.”

According to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that conducts daily analyses of combat developments, Russian fighters appear to be positioned to conduct a “turning movement” aimed at forcing Ukrainian troops to pull back from certain defensive positions. Ukrainian forces have destroyed several bridges in the area, ISW has said.

ISW, in its Saturday assessment, said that Russian forces “have not yet forced Ukrainian forces to withdraw and will likely not be able to encircle the city soon.”

Britain’s Defense Ministry said over the weekend that Ukraine’s position in Bakhmut was “under increasingly severe pressure” and cited additional Russian advances on the city’s northern edges.

Advertisement

Prigozhin, meanwhile, has claimed in recent days that Bakhmut is “practically surrounded” and that his fighters control all the main roads leading out of it.

The Russians have been pressuring the city from the north, east and south. Ukraine’s fallback positions generally lie to the west.

Ukrainian military leaders have already indicated that they would not attempt to hold the city at any cost, potentially choosing to reserve manpower for their spring campaign, which is expected to begin in coming weeks.

"Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan on Sunday shared his concerns about recent headline-making safety issues for America's rail and aviation systems, which he said underscored the need for congressional oversight.

""We need to be proactive, not reactive, with regard to these kinds of public safety transportation issues,"" Sullivan told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos.

In particular, Sullivan singled out the importance of legislative proposals and hearings by lawmakers as well as companies maintaining updated infrastructure.

The Republican lawmaker sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is set to hear testimony on Thursday from the CEO of Norfolk Southern, the company whose train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, last month, spilling toxic chemicals.

""What do you want to hear from him [CEO Alan Shaw]?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

""Well, I want to hear some of the issues that Sen. [Sherrod] Brown raised, and in particular some of the issues that related to the laying off of workers,"" Sullivan said. ""It's not just going to be him. It's going to be government officials as well on what is happening.""

Echoing Brown's separate appearance on ""This Week"" on Sunday, Sullivan said, ""There's a number of train derailments that happened across the country ... And we need to get to the bottom of why these are happening.""

Brown, a Democrat, and Ohio Republican Sen. J.D. Vance recently proposed a bill intended increase rail safety in the wake of the East Palestine derailment. (Norfolk Southern has said it wants to work to ensure there aren't future incidents like that one.)

""I'm actually glad that Sen. Brown and Sen. Vance have put forward some good bipartisan legislation,"" Sullivan told Stephanopoulos when asked whether he supports their bill. ""I agree with Sen. Brown: It shouldn't take a disaster to have good oversight legislation to make sure that we have a safe rail system. But really importantly [what] I've focused on, George, is a safe aviation system.""

Sullivan pointed to ""several near misses"" recently at various airports and ""huge warning signs"" about underlying problems.

Stephanopoulos asked if the lack of a permanent Federal Aviation Administration chief was ""hampering"" the safety efforts.

""I think it absolutely it is,"" Sullivan said.

President Joe Biden recently nominated Phil Washington to head the FAA, but Sullivan expressed concern over Washington's background: ""He's somebody who served in the Army, honorably, but doesn't have a lot of experience with regard to aviation safety. So we'll see what happens.""

""We need to be on this in terms of safety, now,"" Sullivan said. ""Americans take for granted that their aviation safety, flying in America, is the safest place to do it in the world.""

Sullivan said he had come away from the aviation hearings so far focused on needed infrastructure upgrades.

""One of the big things is they need [to be] much more aggressive focus on updating their technology and infrastructure. That's come out in the hearings. And I think that's something that we need to make sure -- again, proactively,"" he said.

Stephanopoulos turned the conversation to the ongoing war in Ukraine, asking for a response to Biden's hesitation to send F-16 fighter jets, with administration officials stressing logistical hurdles like training.

""They need these weapon systems now,"" Sullivan said of the Ukrainians. ""And this has been a pattern -- an unfortunate pattern by this administration -- delaying critical weapons systems until we [in Congress] pressure them. They finally get them there, but it oftentimes takes way too late.""

Sullivan said this previously played out with munitions like the Patriot missile system and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS.

""They've sent them only after being pressured by Congress. It took Patriots nine months,"" he said.

Stephanopoulos also pressed Sullivan about who he will support in the next presidential race. The senator played down the ""hypothetical"" possibility that former President Donald Trump could be under indictment while running in 2024.

""So, you'll support Donald Trump if he's the nominee, even if he's indicted?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

""That's a huge hypothetical right now on the indictment issue,"" Sullivan responded. ""We'll see if that plays out. But right now my plan is to support whoever becomes the nominee.""

When asked about the indictment himself, Trump said Saturday that he would ""absolutely"" remain in the race for the White House. He has denied wrongdoing in the various investigations he faces.

On ""This Week,"" Sullivan noted that there are other qualified candidates running or likely to run for the nomination.

""I think having a good, competitive primary with a new generation of Republicans, by the way, is healthy for our party,"" he said. ""It's healthy for the country, and I plan on supporting the nominee who wins the Republican nomination."""

In late February 2023, Russian conscripted soldiers were ordered to attack concrete-reinforced Ukrainian positions, being armed with ""firearms and shovels."" The ""shovels"" are likely entrenching tools being employed for hand-to-hand combat, the UK agency said.

""The lethality of the standard-issue MPL-50 entrenching tool is particularly mythologized in Russia. Little changed since it was designed in 1869, its continued use as a weapon highlights the brutal and low-tech fighting which has come to characterize much of the war,"" it added.

Namely, one reservist said he wasn't ready either physically, or psychologically for such combat.

As British intelligence reported earlier, the Ukrainian defense of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast is under ""increasingly severe pressure"" of intense fighting in and around the town. Two key bridges in Bakhmut were destroyed in the past week.

"Kheiron said the technology worked best alongside doctors, not in lieu of them. Scotland’s National Health Service will use it as an additional reader of mammography scans at six sites, and it will be in about 30 breast cancer screening sites operated by England’s National Health Service by the end of the year. Oulu University Hospital in Finland plans to use the technology as well, and a bus will travel around Oman this year to perform breast cancer screenings using A.I.

“An A.I.-plus-doctor should replace doctor alone, but an A.I. should not replace the doctor,” Mr. Kecskemethy said.

The National Cancer Institute has estimated that about 20 percent of breast cancers are missed during screening mammograms.

Constance Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and chief of breast imaging and radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, urged doctors to keep an open mind.

“We are not irrelevant,” she said, “but there are tasks that are better done with computers.”

At Bács-Kiskun County Hospital outside Budapest, Dr. Ambrózay said she had initially been skeptical of the technology — but was quickly won over. She pulled up the X-ray of a 58-year-old woman with a tiny tumor spotted by the A.I. that Dr. Ambrózay had a hard time seeing.

The A.I. saw something, she said, “that seemed to appear out of nowhere.”"
"David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from the Tampa area, said that Mr. DeSantis’s legislative goals may pose “zero risk” for him in a presidential primary but could prove to be a tougher sell to more moderate voters in a general election.

“There’s always a disconnect between primaries and generals for both parties, but recent lessons from the last three cycles suggest that Republicans can go too far,” said Mr. Jolly, who is now registered without party affiliation.

Not all legislation has been filed yet, and more contentious proposals may come, as they often do, later in the session, giving legislative leaders more time to iron out thorny details — and leaving less time to debate them.

Mr. DeSantis, who signed a law last year banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy — down from 24 weeks, though not as strict as what many conservatives states have passed — has said he would sign further “pro-life” legislation.

But he has not specified which additional abortion restrictions he would support, reflecting the political tightrope he has to walk on the issue, given that abortion restrictions are not that popular in Florida — even if they appeal widely to his base. Anti-abortion groups are pressing him and lawmakers to pass either a full abortion ban or prohibit the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy.

Republican legislative leaders have said an abortion bill is in the works.

Mr. DeSantis has also laid out immigration proposals that would repeal the in-state tuition discount for Florida residents attending state college and universities who were brought into the country illegally as children.

In a sign of how far to the right Mr. DeSantis has pulled his party, that policy would undo a law signed in 2014 by then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, and championed at the time by other Republicans who remain in top state government positions, including Mr. DeSantis’s lieutenant governor, Jeanette M. Núñez."
"At least 2,000 huts damaged in one of the 32 camps in Cox’s Bazar district where more than 1.2 million people live.

A massive fire raced through a crammed refugee camp for Rohingya people in southern Bangladesh, leaving thousands homeless, a fire official and the United Nations said.

At least 2,000 huts were damaged or burned by the fire that broke out on Sunday, officials from the Balukhali fire department told Al Jazeera.

The blaze hit Camp 11 in Cox’s Bazar, a border district where more than a million Rohingya refugees live, with most having fled a military-led crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.

Reporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury said Balukhali camp is one of the 32 camps in Cox’s Bazar.

“Each hut has four to five people living together as a family and at least half of the population is women and children,” Chowdhury said, adding that fire and rescue officials have not reported any casualties so far but they are still searching for people.

He explained that the region where the fire broke out is quite hilly, making it difficult for rescue teams to reach and for families to escape.

“The health facilities [in the area] are very rudimentary to have a fast response. There are a lot of field hospitals but not enough to respond to 1.2 million people,” he added.

The UN refugee agency’s Regina De La Portilla told Al Jazeera that most shelters in the camp are made with bamboo and tarpaulin.

“The materials we use in the camps are all temporary that can catch fire, and it spreads quickly due to the congested nature of the camps,” she said.

Dealing with trauma

Portilla said a third of the camp’s population has lost their homes and belongings in the fire and that the UN was providing mental healthcare services.

“We have deployed 90 community health workers [also refugees], who have been trained to provide first aid and psychological support, and if somebody needs further support they are referred to health services to deal with this type of mental trauma,” she said.

More than one million Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar over several decades, including about 740,000 who crossed the border starting in August 2017, when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown.

Conditions in Myanmar have worsened since a military takeover in 2021, and attempts to send them back have failed.

Last year, the United States said the oppression of the Rohingya in Myanmar amounts to genocide after US authorities confirmed accounts of mass atrocities against civilians by the military in a systematic campaign against the ethnic minority.

The mostly Muslim Rohingya face widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where most are denied citizenship and many other rights."
